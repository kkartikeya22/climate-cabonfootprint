# Energy Consumption Analytics

## Overview

The energy consumption analytics project aims to analyze and derive insights from energy consumption data to inform decision-making related to energy management and sustainability. Leveraging data analytics techniques, the project focuses on understanding energy consumption patterns, identifying trends, and exploring opportunities for optimization.

## Analysis

The analysis involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, filtering, and formatting raw energy consumption data to prepare it for analysis.

2. **Statistical Analysis**: Computing descriptive statistics, trends, and correlations to gain insights into energy consumption patterns and drivers.

3. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations such as charts, graphs, and maps to effectively communicate findings and trends in energy consumption.

4. **Modeling**: Developing predictive models, such as linear regression or time series forecasting, to forecast future energy consumption based on historical data and external factors.

## Insights

The analytics provide valuable insights into:

- Energy consumption trends over time.
- Regional variations in energy usage.
- Factors influencing peak demand and energy consumption spikes.
- Predictive models for forecasting energy consumption and demand.

## Carbon Footprint Calculation

As part of the energy consumption analytics project, a formula has been developed to calculate the carbon footprint of organizations. The formula incorporates various factors such as electricity usage, natural gas usage, diesel/petrol usage, heating oil usage, solid waste generation, liquid waste generation, hazardous waste generation, mileage per vehicle, and the number of company vehicles. The carbon footprint is calculated using the following formula:

Total Carbon Footprint = (Electricity usage * 0.4) + (Natural gas usage * 0.2) + (Diesel/petrol usage * 2.68) + (Heating oil usage * 2.93) +
                         (Solid waste generation * 0.6) + (Liquid waste generation * 0.5) + (Hazardous waste generation * 1.0) +
                         (Mileage per vehicle * Num vehicles * 0.4)

The units for each parameter are as follows:

- Electricity usage is in kWh
- Natural gas usage is in m^3
- Diesel/petrol usage is in liters
- Heating oil usage is in liters
- Solid waste generation is in kilograms
- Liquid waste generation is in liters
- Hazardous waste generation is in kilograms
- Mileage per vehicle is in miles
- Num vehicles is the number of company vehicles

## Conclusion

By leveraging data-driven approaches and advanced analytics techniques, organizations and policymakers can make informed decisions to optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and mitigate environmental impact. The energy consumption analytics project serves as a valuable tool for guiding energy management strategies and sustainability initiatives.
